## FAQ
* Dependency errors raised when running the code.
	* If you are prompted to update the transformer, please do so (typically, it would be `pip install transformers -U`). If you are prompted to install a particular tokenizer package (typically, it would be `0.9.4`), please follow the prompt and install the particular version
*  Missing Word2Vec file.
	* You can download any word2vec file and put it in the project root dictionary. Rename it as `amazon_review_300d.vec`. In the paper, we used this [file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BFrnjV0LMfsnPcTcHyQ4LKHWV065GzBq/view)
* Missing result folder
	* We have put the blank result folders with the code. If it still complaints about missing, please manually create the result folder as needed.
